\section{Jehle \& Reny 5.4 - Excess demand function and GE}

Derive the excess demand function $z(p)$ for the economy in Example 5.1. Verify that it satisfies
Walras' law.

\section{Jehle \& Reny 5.5 - WEA and Edgeworth box}

In Example 5.1, calculate the consumersâ€™ Walrasian equilibrium allocations and illustrate in an
Edgeworth box. Sketch in the contract curve and identify the core.

\section{Jehle \& Reny 5.11 - Pareto-efficient allocations and WEA}

Consider a two-consumer, two-good exchange economy. Utility functions and endowments are

$$u^1(x_1,x_2) = (x_1x_2)^2 \ \ \ and \ \ \  e^1 = (18,4)$$
$$u^2(x_1,x_2) = ln(x_1) + 2 ln(x_2) \ \ \ and \ \ \  e^2 = (3,6)$$

\begin{enumerate}
\item Characterise the set of Pareto-efficient allocations as completely as possible.
\item Characterise the core of this economy.
\item Find a Walrasian equilibrium and compute the WEA.
\item Verify that the WEA you found in part (c) is in the core.
\end{enumerate}
