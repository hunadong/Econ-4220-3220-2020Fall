\section{Jehle \& Reny 2.3}
Derive the consumerâ€™s direct utility function if his indirect utility function has the form $v(p, y) =
yp_1^\alpha p_2^\beta$ for negative $\alpha$ and $\beta$.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Jehle \& Reny 2.5(a)}
Consider the solution, $e(p, u) = up_1^{\alpha_1}p_2^{\alpha_2}p_3^{\alpha_3}$ at the end of Example 2.3.
Derive the indirect utility function through the relation $e(p, v(p, y)) = y$ and verify Roy's
identity.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Jehle \& Reny 2.7}
Derive the consumer's \textbf{inverse} demand functions, $p_1(x_1, x_2)$ and $p_2(x_1, x_2)$, 
when the utility function is of the Cobb-Douglas form, $u(x_1, x_2) = Ax_1^{\alpha}x_2^{1-\alpha}$
for $0 < \alpha < 1$.
