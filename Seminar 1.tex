\section{Jehle \& Reny 1.8. Axioms of consumer choice}

Sketch a map of indifference sets that are all \textbf{parallel}, \textbf{negatively sloped 
straight lines}, with \textbf{preference increasing north-easterly}.We know that preferences 
such as these satisfy Axioms 1, 2, 3, and 4. 

Prove that they also satisfy Axiom 5'. 

Prove that they do not satisfy Axiom 5.

\subsection{Axiom 1. Completeness}
\textbf{We can always choose}

$\forall \ x^1, x^2$ in $X$, we have: $x^1 \succsim  x^2$ or $x^2 \succsim  x^3$  or both

\subsection{Axiom 2. Transitivity}


\subsection{Axiom 3. Continuity}


\subsection{Axiom 4'. Local non-satiation}

\subsection{Axiom 4. Strict monotonicity}

\subsection{Axiom 5'. Convexity}

\subsection{Axiom 4. Strict convexity}

\section{Jehle \& Reny 1.9}

Sketch a map of indifference sets that are \textbf{all parallel right angles that ‘kink’ on the line $x_1 = x_2$}. If
\textbf{preference increases north-easterly}, these preferences will satisfy Axioms 1, 2, 3, and 4'. 

Prove that they also satisfy Axiom 5'. 

Do they satisfy Axiom 4? 

Do they satisfy Axiom 5?

\section{Jehle \& Reny 1.13}
A consumer has lexicographic preferences over $x R2$ if the relation  satisfies $x_1, x_2$ whenever
$x_1^1 > x_1^2$, or $x_1^1 = x_1^2$ and $x_1^1 \ge x_1^2$.

(a) Sketch an indifference map for these preferences.

(b) Can these preferences be represented by a continuous utility function? Why or why not?

\section{Jehle \& Reny 1.15}
Prove that the budget set, $B$, is a \textbf{compact, convex set whenever $p \gg 0$}.

\section{Jehle \& Reny 1.26}
A consumer of \textbf{two goods} faces \textbf{positive prices} and has a \textbf{positive income}. 
His utility function is $$u(x_1, x_2) = x_1$$ 

Derive the Marshallian demand functions.

\section{Jehle \& Reny 1.27}
A consumer of \textbf{two goods} faces \textbf{positive} prices and has a \textbf{positive income}. 
His utility function is $$u(x_1, x_2) = max[ax_1, ax_2] + min[x_1, x_2], \ \ where \ 0 < a < 1.$$
Derive the Marshallian demand functions.
