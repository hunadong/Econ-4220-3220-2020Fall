\section{Jehle \& Reny 1.8. Axioms of consumer choice}

Sketch a map of indifference sets that are all \textbf{parallel}, \textbf{negatively sloped 
straight lines}, with \textbf{preference increasing north-easterly}.We know that preferences 
such as these satisfy Axioms 1, 2, 3, and 4. 
\begin{itemize}
\item Prove that they also satisfy Axiom 5'. 
\item Prove that they do not satisfy Axiom 5.
\end{itemize}

\begin{mdframed}[backgroundcolor=blue!20,linecolor=white] 

\textbf{Review: 5 Axioms of consumer choice (JR pp. 5-12)}

\vspace{2mm}

The preference (indifference curve) shown in Figure \ref{fig:familiar} is classical in all
economics classes. Why does it look like this way?

\vspace{2mm}

{\centering
\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=1.2]
\draw [->] (0,0) node [below] {0} -- (0,0) -- (5.5,0) node [below] {$x_1$};
\draw [->] (0,0) node [below] {0} -- (0,0) -- (0,5.5) node [left] {$x_2$};

\draw (0.3,5) to [out=280,in=175] (5.5,0.5);
\draw (1,5) to [out=280,in=175] (5.5,1.2);
\draw (1.6,5) to [out=280,in=175] (5.5,1.8);
\end{tikzpicture}
\captionof{figure}{An indifference map}
\label{fig:familiar}}
\vspace{2mm}

The most basic assumptions about our preference are Axiom 1.  and Axiom 2. 

\begin{itemize}
\item Axiom 1. Completeness (We can always choose)
$\forall \ x^1, x^2$ in $X$, we have: $x^1 \succsim  x^2$ or $x^2 \succsim  x^3$  or both
\item Axiom 2. Transitivity
$\forall \ x^1, x^2$, and  $x^3$ in $X$, if $x^1 \succsim  x^2$ and $x^2 \succsim  x^3$, then $x^1 \succsim  x^3$
\end{itemize}

With Axiom 1. and Axiom 2. , the preference set can be:

\vspace{2mm}

{\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{1.open}
\captionof{figure}{Hypothetical preferences satisfying Axioms 1 and 2.}
\label{open}}
\vspace{2mm}

What happens around the "boundary"?

\begin{itemize}
\item Axiom 3. Continuity (define boundary)

$\succsim (x)$ and $\precsim (x)$ sets are closed in $R^n_+$ for $x \in R^n_+ $.
\end{itemize}

Once the boundary is properly defined, there is no sudden preference reversal any more.
Now the preference set looks like Figure \ref{fig:ball}

\vspace{2mm}

{\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{1.ball}
\captionof{figure}{Hypothetical preferences satisfying Axioms 1, 2, and 3.}
\label{fig:ball}}

\vspace{2mm}

Further more, we assume "unlimited wants" can be represented by our preference.
For example, we can try Axiom 4'.

\begin{itemize}
\item Axiom 4'. Local non-satiation (always something better around)

$\forall \ x^0 \in R^n_+ \ $ and $ \ \forall \ \epsilon > 0$, $\exists x 
\in B_{\epsilon}(x^0) \cap R^n_+ \ $ s.t. $\ x \succ x^0$
\end{itemize}


Axiom 4' rulled out the "indifference zone" in Figure \ref{fig:ball} and our preference set
is deduced into Figure \ref{fig:line}.
\vspace{2mm}

{\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{1.line}
\captionof{figure}{Hypothetical preferences satisfying Axioms 1, 2, 3 and 4'}
\label{fig:line}}
\vspace{2mm}

However, Axiom 4' doesn't mean "the more, the better (at least not worse)" shown in Figure \ref{fig:mono}.
\vspace{2mm}

{\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{1.mono}
\captionof{figure}{Hypothetical preferences satisfying Axioms 1, 2, 3 and 4' again}
\label{fig:mono}}
\vspace{2mm}

To depict this, we assume Axiom 4 instead.

\begin{itemize}
\item Axiom 4. Strict monotonicity (the more, the better)

$\forall \ x^0, x^1 \in R^n_+ \ $, if $x^0 \ge x^1, \ $ then  $\ x^0 \succsim x^1 \ $, while if 
$x^0 \gg x^1, \ $ then  $\ x^0 \succ x^1$.
\end{itemize}

A set of preferences satisfying Axioms 1, 2, 3, and 4 is given in Figure \ref{fig:closest}
\vspace{2mm}

{\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{1.closest}
\captionof{figure}{Hypothetical preferences satisfying Axioms 1, 2, 3 and 4}
\label{fig:closest}}
\vspace{2mm}

In addition, we assume people prefer "balanced" than "extreme" bundles in consumption.
Either Axiom 5' or Axiom 5 can guarantee this, but Axiom 5 will make our analysis easier in the future.

\begin{itemize}

\item Axiom 5'. Convexity

If $\ x^1 \succsim x^0 \ $, then $\ tx^1 + (1-t)x^0 \succsim x^0 \ $ for all $\ t \in [0,1]$

\item Axiom 5. Strict convexity

If $\ x^1 \ne x^0 \ $ and $\ x^1 \succsim x^0 \ $, then $\ tx^1 + (1-t)x^0 \succ x^0 \ $ for all $\ t \in (0,1)$

\end{itemize}

Both Axiom 5' and Axiom 5 can rule out the concave-to-the-origin segments in Figure \ref{fig:closest}.
Finally, we our indifference curve looks the same as in Figure \ref{fig:familiar} and Figure \ref{fig:final}

\vspace{2mm}

\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{1.final}
\captionof{figure}{Hypothetical preferences satisfying Axioms 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5'/5}

\end{mdframed}

As required by question 1.8, a map of the indifference sets is showed in Figure \ref{fig:1_8}

{\centering
\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.85]
\draw [->] (0,0) node [below] {0} -- (0,0) -- (9,0) node [below] {$x_1$};
\draw [->] (0,0) node [below] {0} -- (0,0) -- (0,6) node [left] {$x_2$};

\draw [thick] (1,1.5) -- (3,0.5);
\draw [thick] (1,2.5) -- (5,0.5);

\draw [thick] (1,5.5) -- (8,2);

\end{tikzpicture}
\captionof{figure}{A map of the indifference sets for Q.1.8}

%***************************************************
\subsection{Prove that they also satisfy Axiom 5'}

\begin{itemize}
\item Read JR. pp. 501 for the definition of Convex combination.
\end{itemize}

For any given bundle $x^0$ in Figure \ref{fig:1_8_a5'}, we can always
find another bundle $x^1$ either on the same indifference curve with $x^0$ lying on
or to the northeast of $x^0$ s.t. $x^1 \succsim x^0$.

No matter which case, the convex combination of $x^0$ and $x^1$ is always at least 
as good as $x^0$

%***************************************************
\subsection{Prove that they do not satisfy Axiom 5}

To prove the preferences do not satisfy Axiom 5, we only need to 
give one example of the violation.

In Figure \ref{fig:1_8_a5}, $x^1 \ne x^0$ and $x^1 \succsim x^0$, but
$x^t=tx^1+(1-t)x^0 \nsucc x^0$ for any $t \in (0,1)$

\subsection{Do they satisfy Axiom 4?}

Yes. Any bundle ${x^0}'$ that contains at least as much of every good as $x^1$ does
(i.e. ${x^0}' \ge x^1$ )can only lies in the shaded area including the border. 
Obviously, ${x^0}' \succsim x^1$.

In addition, for any ${x^0}$ contains strictly more of every good than $x^1$ 
does (i.e. ${x^0}' \gg x^1$ ), we have ${x^0} \succ x^1$
